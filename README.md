**How It Works**

This free PostNL tracking integration leverages a REST sensor to retrieve comprehensive tracking information. By setting up two input sensors and an automation, you can seamlessly monitor and update your PostNL tracking data without any additional costs.

**Key Components**

1. **Input Sensors:** This integration requires two input sensors - one for the tracking code and another for the postal code. When you update these values, the automation is triggered to refresh the tracking information.
2. **Automation:** The automation component listens for changes in the input sensors. When the tracking code or postal code is modified, it initiates a request to the PostNL API via the REST sensor to obtain the latest tracking data.
3. **Resource Template:** To seamlessly call data from the two input sensors, the integration creates a resource template. This template assists in constructing the URL for the REST sensor to access the PostNL API.

**Entities and Attributes**

The integration generates a collection of entities with associated attributes for a detailed view of your PostNL tracking:

* **Sender Information:** Contains sender details such as name, address, postal code, town, and company name.
* **Receiver Information:** Provides receiver information, including name, sender, company, postal code, and town.
* **Delivery Information:** This entity is the hub for comprehensive tracking details. It includes attributes like delivery status, delivery date, delivery time, return shipment status, and much more.

**With this improved integration, you can easily track your PostNL shipments and access all the essential tracking information right in your Home Assistant dashboard.**
